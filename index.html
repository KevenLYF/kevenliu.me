	<h1>Machine Learning: Learn Music</h1>
	<p>In this project, our team built a neural network on myRIO logic board by using labVIEW. The main feature of this neural network is to learn music (recoginize tones).
	By listening to the tones or chords, the program will tell which tone or chord is being played. 
	<br>
	</p>

	<img src=file/ml1.jpg alt="myRIO borad" class="myRIO">

	<p > The recognition requires two modes: a "training" mode and a "inference" mode. In "training" mode, we feed the dataset into the feedback network, and it will update it's parameters in the backpropagation algorithm which we wrote in labVIEW. The training process will finish once it's output posibility is at the closet point to "1". In "inference" mode, we will play tones and chords, and the program will tell us what it just heard. The accuracy of our program exceed 95%. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Below is the overview of our program, and if interested, you can download our report.

	<h1>Cross Platform TA Management System</h1>

	<p class="note"> 
	Note: as mentioned by my teammate, the new McGill MyFuture website may "copied" my website design :)   
	<a href="https://caps.myfuture.mcgill.ca/students/?signin_tab=0&PHPSESSID=2a77fc742618417627b985daec06ec5c" class="mfLink">link to myFuture</a> 

	</p>

	<p>
	<br>   
	<br>
	We developed a TA management System in 3 platfroms: a Java program in PC, an Android app and a website which is written in HTML, CSS and PHP. The system enables students to apply for a TA position, or a professor to review all the TA applications.
	</p>

	<img src=file/TA3.png alt="android" width="276" height="501" class="android">
	<p>
	<br>
	The system was developed under standard software development process. First we used Umple modeling tool to model the system and then we used git to collaborate everyone's work. The development process was also tracked by using Gantt Chart. After the developemnt was done, we performed Unit Test and Integration Test by using respective frameworks (JUnit, PHP Unit, XDebug). The CI and building process was monitored by using Travis CI.

 	<h1>AM Reciever</h1>
 		<p>The AM reciever, which commonly known as radio is a device that takes baseband frequency as input and output audio information. We made a radio station from the most original materials: wires, resistors, capacitors, BJTs and MOSFETs. The development process is caculation - simulation - assembling. We used knowledge learned from microelectronic classes to calculate parameters, and simulated the whole design in PSPICE.

 	<h1>Enigma Encryption Machine</h1>

 		<p> Yes, it is "the" Enigma Encryption Machine that was being invented by German Army during the World War II. What we build here is an electronic version which is being implemented on a FPGA board. To give you a little context, an Enigma Machine takes your input (letters) and encrypts it based on your encryption settings. As a reciever, simply adjust your encryption settings to match the sender's and enter the encrypted letters, you will get the intelligence information.
 		<br>
 		</p>
 		 		<img src="file/enigma3.jpg" alt="Enigma" class="enigma1">
 		<p>
 		<br>
 		The famous movie "The Imitation Game" which is acted by Benedict Cumberbatch, described a story of how Turing cracked the Enigma machine by using the "Computer" he invented. At the end of the project, I was really impressed by the wisdom of human mind power at that time.

 		The robot has five rotors, two ultrasonic sensors, one light senser and color sensor. It was programmed in Java to perform localization, navigation, searching and capture. It was able to pick up a target object from a maze which contains differect obstacles.

		<h1><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2" class="dotaTitle">Dota 2 </a> </h1>
		<p>
		Dota 2 is a multiplayer strategy video game which has a widespread and active competitive scene, with teams from across the world playing professionally in various leagues and tournaments. The total prize tool for all of the Dota 2 tournaments combined since 2011 has exceeded 100 million dollars.

		<br>
		<br>
		I was the captain of McGill Dota 2 team (division 2, 2013 - 2014), and I led my team joined the <a href="https://cstarleague.com/" class="dotaTitle"> Collegiate Starleague</a> which involves more than 100 university teams in NA. Our match record was 18-1 and we ranked top 3.

		<br>
		<br>
		To prove I'm not bragging, I've attached some screenshots of our match status.
